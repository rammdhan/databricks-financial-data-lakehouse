# Databricks Financial Data Lakehouse

**End-to-End Data Engineering Project** for transforming raw SEC financial filings into **AI-ready data** using the **Databricks Lakehouse Platform (Free Edition)**.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates how a **Data Engineer** can build a **streaming data pipeline** that ingests, transforms, and prepares financial reports from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into a structured, queryable, and AI-ready dataset.
The final output is a **Lakehouse architecture** that supports **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** use cases â€” enabling AI chatbots or analytical models to access structured financial knowledge efficiently.

## Objectives

- Build a **streaming ingestion pipeline** for JSON-based SEC filings  
- Transform and normalize raw financial data (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow)  
- Convert structured data into **textual documents** suitable for AI models  
- Generate **vector embeddings** and assemble a **Databricks Vector Search Index**
